1. You should understand all of the sort algorithm to fulfill requiremens.
2. Using linked list can avoid extra space. For merge sort, we need O(n) for array, but O(1) for linked list.
3. For linked list operation, we can define more necessary variables to make us more clear.
4. Doing linked list problems, be careful of the head. We can process it in different way to avoid the complexity of the problems.
