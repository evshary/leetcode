1. We should not assume that array is sorted.
2. Although sorting array may decrease running time, we may need  the index of origin array, not the index of sorted array.
3. It's possible to decrease time complexity by increasing space complexity. Use hash table to save number, and we can check whether the complement of each number exists or not. Ref:[1. Two Sum: solution](https://leetcode.com/articles/two-sum/)
