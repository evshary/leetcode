1. If I use divide and conquer without memoization, it takes too long to calculate the result.
2. Using DP to solve the problem is much faster. However it's important to think of using A to save the temparory value. The key point is the min path to get A[i][j] is min(A[i-1][j-1], A[i-1][j], A[i-1][j+1]).
