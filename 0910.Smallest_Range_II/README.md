1. We can convert -K~K into 0~2K. This is better for our thinking.
2. We know that the smaller element should be added 2K and the larger element should be added zero. However, we need to find out a certain number to add 2K on number smaller than it and add 0 on number larger than it.
3. We don't need to find the number with math formula. Just try it. Assume the result is largest - smallest in original array. Then we can try to add 2*K on each number and find out which is the exact result.
